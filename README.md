# DigitalCrafts GitHub Tracker

This is a github tracker, the goal being that it can be an up to date index of digital crafts students and alumni by cohort so that you can get a “where are they now” sense of alumni by their programming projects as well as a recruiting tool for employers looking at Digital Crafts.

My objective in opening this up is that even though it’s a tiny project, it’ll give open source experience to everyone who wants to contribute as well as giving me experience in maintaining something that is open source. Currently it only needs the dataset to be completed, but feel free to add to the UI or documentation. Just fork and send a pull request.
